Into Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation (AI4EO) :satellite:.

### Want to know me a bit more?

Francisco Mena is a Master of Science (MSc) graduate from Federico Santa MarÃ­a Technical University (UTFSM, in Chile) where he also studied for his Bachelor of Science in the field of Computer Engineering specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Always interested in building automated systems that help society, he joined the Chilean Virtual Observatory (CHiVO) during his undergraduate studies in 2017. Later during the Master's program (from 2018) he explores three different areas using Artificial Intelligence: Crowdsourcing, Astroinformatics, and Information Retrieval (Similarity Search). Once he obtained his Master's degree he start working as a Part-time Lecturer at the same institution where he studied (UTFSM) in 2020, teaching the course Computational Statistics and Artificial Neural Networks.

##### More interested in my profile?

Here I share the different areas where I had working on:

* Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation :satellite:: I started to explore this topic at the start of my PhD inside the [ESALab group](https://www.ai4eo-factory.de/en-index.html) at DFKI under the supervision of Professor [Andreas Dengel](https://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~dengel/indexEng.php) and co-supervisor Diego Arenas.
> Survey Paper (under review): [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01200)  
> Conference paper: on Crop Classification [IGARSS 23'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05407) (1st author, [slides](./presentations/2023_IGARSS_MVC.pdf) , [code](https://github.com/fmenat/MultiviewCropClassification)), on Crop Yield Prediction [IGARSS 23'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08948) (3th author, [slides](./presentations/2023_IGARSS_IFYieldPred.pdf))  
> Summary of PhD research: [Poster 2023](./posters/2023_Poster_PhD.pdf)

* Crowdsourcing: I started to explore this topic during my Master's thesis under the supervision of Professor [Ricardo Ã‘anculef](https://investigadores.anid.cl/es/public_search/researcher?id=18295). You can find my different contributions to the scientific community here:  
> Journal Paper:  [IDA 20'](https://doi.org/10.3233/IDA-200009)  (1st author, [code](https://github.com/FMena14/MixtureofGroups))  
> Conference Paper: [CIARP 19'](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33904-3_46) (1st author, [slides](./presentations/2019_CIARP_CMM.pdf))  
> Small library: [PyLearningCrowds](https://github.com/fmenat/PyLearningCrowds)  

* Astroinformatics: I started to explore this topic during my involvement with ChiVO and with the collaboration of Professor [Marcelo Araya](https://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~maray/wiki/doku.php). You can find my different contributions to the scientific community here:  
> Journal paper: [CLEI-EJ 19'](https://doi.org/10.19153/cleiej.22.3.3) (shared 1st author, [code](https://github.com/fmenat/ExoplanetDetection)), [Astronomy and Computing 21'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2021.100461) (3th author, [poster](./posters/2020_MTF.pdf), [code](https://github.com/Buguemar/PIIC19/tree/master/code/obj1)), [Signals 21'](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/signals2040042) (1st author, [poster](./posters/2020_VAE.pdf), [code](https://github.com/Buguemar/PIIC19/tree/master/code/obj4))  
> Conference paper: [CLEI 18'](https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2018.00041)  (shared 1st author, [poster](./posters/2018_ChileWIC_exoplanet.pdf), [slides](./presentations/2018_SLIOA-CLEI_Exoplanet.pdf), [extended slides](./presentations/2019_DI-UTFSM_Exoplanet.pdf)), [ADASS 19'](https://www.aspbooks.org/a/volumes/article_details/?paper_id=39815) (third author, [poster](./posters/2019_ADASS_Exoplanet.pdf))  

* Similarity Search: I started to explore this topic in a course project of Professor [Marcelo Mendoza](https://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~mmendoza/) and further development with Professor [Ricardo Ã‘anculef](https://investigadores.anid.cl/es/public_search/researcher?id=18295) and with a recent collaboration with the Univ. of Bologna.
